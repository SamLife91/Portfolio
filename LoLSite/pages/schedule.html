	<h1>Tournament Format</h1>
	<h4 class="center">Group Stage</h4>
	<p class="description">The format of the Group Stage is a Best of 1, double Round Robin -- this means each team in a group plays all other teams in that group twice. The top two teams from each group will advance to the Knockout Stage, while the bottom two teams will be eliminated.</p>
	<h4 class="center">Knockout Stage</h4>
	<p class="description">The Knockout Stage is also colloquially referred to as the Bracket Stage. At this stage, the event changes to a Single Elimination bracket. The top two teams from each Group are placed in the Quarterfinals based on their Group finish.Additionally, in the Knockout Stage, the format changes to Best of 5 matches instead of the Best of 1s from the Group Stage. However, similar to the Group Stage, there are some rules that regulate which teams can play each other in the Quarterfinals and Semifinals.No two teams from the same group can be placed on the same half of the bracket (meaning, they would not play until the Finals).In addition, each Quarterfinal will feature one No. 1 seed and one No. 2 seed from Groups. This organization rewards the higher seeds for their performance in the Groups, and prevents rematches before the Finals. Using this guide, the teams will be matched up randomly.The winner of the Knockout Stage will be crowned our 2015 World Champion!</p>
